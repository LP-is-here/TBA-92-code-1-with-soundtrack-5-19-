                        <p><p><em>Nov. 4, 1992</em><br>Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas was elected the 42d President of the United States yesterday, breaking a 12-year Republican hold on the White House.<br>Mr. Clinton shattered the Republicans' political base with a promise of change to an electorate clearly discontented with President Bush.<br>With Bush’s high approval ratings, many pundits assumed that he would sail to reelection. Many speculated potential Democratic candidates chose not to run, with Mario Cuomo focusing on his governorship and Jerry Brown choosing to run a successful Senate campaign instead. This sparse field of candidates allowed Governor Clinton to run for the nomination practically uncontested, with his most prominent opposition in the form of Senator Paul Tsongas dropping out after underperforming on Super Tuesday.<br>Clinton’s ability to easily unite the party behind him has been cited as a large contributor in his strong performance yesterday.<br><br>Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who roiled this race throughout, finished third, drawing roughly equally from both major party candidates, according to Voter Research & Surveys, the television polling consortium. His share of the popular vote had the potential to exceed any third-party candidate's in more than half a century.<br><br>The Governor from Arkansas won such big, closely contested states as Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois. As polls closed across the nation, networks announced projected winners based on voter surveys. It was Ohio that put him over the top shortly before 11 P.M., followed closely by California. Based on those projections, Mr. Bush prevailed in his adopted state of Texas and other pockets of Republican states around the country.<br><br>In a victory speech to a joyous crowd in Little Rock, Mr. Clinton declared, "On this day, with high hopes and brave hearts, in massive numbers, the American people have voted to make a new beginning."
