This is just a basic roadmap of stuff that needs to be coded in the future:
Basic answer CYOA (not VP switcher) for the primary section
Fixing the campaign issues (needs a quick meeting in GC)
Fixing starting polling (needs a long meeting in GC)
Fixing feedback effects (needs a quick meeting in GC)
Other various 2000-1992 transfers

Feel free to add more, this is just off the top of my head for now.
