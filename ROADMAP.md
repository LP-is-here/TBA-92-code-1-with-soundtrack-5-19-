 <br> This is just a basic roadmap of stuff that needs to be coded in the future:
 <br> -<s>Basic answer CYOA (not VP switcher) for the primary section<s/> COMPLETE
 <br> -Basic answer CYOA (not VP switcher) for the post primary
 <br> -Fixing the campaign issues (These are mainly implemented but need some touching up)
 <br> -Fixing starting polling (Also needs touching up but it looks fine I guess)
 <br> -Fixing feedback effects (needs a quick meeting in GC)
 <br> -Other various 2000-1992 transfers

 <br> Feel free to add more, this is just off the top of my head for now.
